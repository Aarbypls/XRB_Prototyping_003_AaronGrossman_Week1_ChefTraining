# Chef Training Prototype

## Concept

A very simple VR simulation of a cooking environment, in which the goal is to prepare a meal, consisting of one or more sources of protein (lamb and salmon) as well as a fruit salad, with two different kinds of fruit (melons and peaches). 

At the beginning of the game the menu in front of the player will generate a random meal that is to be served; it will then be the job of the player to prepare that meal according to the exact specifications.

Each of these items have their own characteristics - the leg of lamb, for example, needs to be served cooked and whole. The salmon also needs to be cooked, but can be cut into smaller pieces (whole, to fillet, to smaller cuts) depending on what is called for. The fruit are of varying sizes and can be cut into halves and slices if necessary.

Ingredients can be gotten from the fridge and food preparation areas, and the oven is used to cook the food over an amount of time. 

All of the food needs to be put into the area to the right of the counter; once all of the required food (cooked, if necessary, and cut up as requested) is entered into the area the game will be considered “complete”.
